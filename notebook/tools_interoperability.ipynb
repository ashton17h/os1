    "# Cross-Framework LLM Tool Integration with os1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to integrate LLM tools from various frameworks—including [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools), [CrewAI Tools](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main), and [PydanticAI Tools](https://ai.pydantic.dev/tools/) into the os1 framework. This process enables smooth interoperability between these systems, allowing developers to leverage the unique capabilities of each toolset within os1's flexible agent-based architecture. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to configure agents, adapt these tools for use in os1, and validate the integration through practical examples."

You can explore the available tools in the [LangChain Community Tools](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/community/langchain_community/tools) folder. These tools, such as those for querying APIs, web scraping, and text generation, can be quickly incorporated into os1, providing powerful functionality for your agents.\n",

    "## PydanticAI Tools Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "[PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is a newer framework that offers powerful capabilities for working with LLMs. Although it currently does not have a repository with pre-built tools, it provides features like **dependency injection**, allowing you to inject a \"Context\" into a tool for better execution without relying on LLMs. This context can be used for passing parameters or managing state during the execution of a tool. While the framework is still growing, you can integrate its tools into os1 to enhance agent capabilities, especially for tasks that involve structured data and context-driven logic.\n",
